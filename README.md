Similarity Based Classification: Determining the Books that Costumers Would Buy in The Future Using Past Purchases and Similarities Between  Different Costumers and Books
Project Abstract: 
In this project we will focus on developing and optimizing a machine learning similarity based classification algorithms to make predictions about the books that consumers will buy in the future. We conduct a variety of experiments and achieve a 68% percent accuracy with a decent validity. This means that we are able to predict future costumer behavior without any actual features using only the similarities between books and users to a certain degree only using a very small sample to train the model. This means that under different circumstances with more data, features and processing power, these numbers could be considerably much more accurate.  This approach could have various applications in behavior predictions such as costumer purchases, investments, etc.

The data set used for this project is included in repository. We have also provided semi detailed project report where we explain the stepts we took for this project.
